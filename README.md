You can check out the link to this website [here](https://jmurray1989.github.io/stream-websites/)

## First Github project
This is the first project we have done from the online coding bootcamp with the Code Institute.

## Project Description
This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program

## Languages Used
In this project we used HTML & CSS and we wrote our code using Gitpod, and we backed it up using Github.
